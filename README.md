Sales Data Analysis Project
📊 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of six years of pharmaceutical sales data. Using Python, it involves cleaning the raw dataset, exploring the data to uncover trends and patterns, and visualizing insights to support data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
Clean and preprocess the sales dataset for analysis

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales trends over time

Identify correlations and seasonal patterns in pharmaceutical product sales

Visualize key findings using charts and graphs for better interpretation

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains sales data spanning six years, including:

Product category-level sales volumes

Time-based columns (Year, Month, Weekday, Hour)

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Editor: Thonny (Python IDE)

Excel: for quick initial inspection
